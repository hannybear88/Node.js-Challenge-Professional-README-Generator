## Description
The motivation of this project is that I can learn how to create a professional README generator. Even though a README can be tedious, takes time, and shouldn't be rushed I enjoy creating READMEs. It is something I always look forward to for every challenge assignment. It is like writing a story of your application. I built this project, so that I can learn how to create a professional README generator and what I learn from this project, I can apply it on the upcoming homework challenges. I'll not only improve on creating professional README generators, but also on my writing skills. I personally feel like READMEs has been my strong suit from the beginning. I had Googled how to create a great README and then from there I continued to do my best on improving on it. What I learned is that creating a professional README generator is quite different from what I am used to, but am open to improving on creating a professional README generator.
