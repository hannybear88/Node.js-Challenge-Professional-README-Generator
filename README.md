# Node.js-Challenge-Professional-README-Generator
HW Challenge #9

## Description 
The motivation of this project is that I can learn how to create a professional README generator. Even though a README can be tedious, takes time, and shouldn't be rushed I enjoy creating READMEs. It is something I always look forward to for every challenge assignment. It is like writing a story of your application. I built this project, so that I can learn how to create a professional README generator and what I learn from this project, I can apply it on the upcoming homework challenges. I'll not only improve on creating professional README generators, but also on my writing skills. I personally feel like READMEs has been my strong suit from the beginning. I had Googled how to create a great README and then from there I continued to do my best on improving on it. What I learned is that creating a professional README generator is quite different from what I am used to, but am open to improving on creating a professional README generator.

## Challenges
A challenge I came across was making sure I understand the homework, so that I was doing it correctly. At first, I had thought the assignment was generating a professional README for this particular assignment. Then with help from my classmate, she had explained to me that the assignment is to learn how generate a professional README in general. 


## Success
The success I am across is creating a professional README. I enjoyed creating the questions and the code for it. At first it was a bit confusing, but with the help from the instructor, TAs, and classmates, it was made more clear and I realized that this assignment is pretty straight forward.
