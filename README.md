# Node.js-Challenge-Professional-README-Generator
HW Challenge #9

## Description 

The motivation of this project is that I can learn how to create a professional README generator. 
Even though a README can be tedious, takes time, and shouldn't be rushed I enjoy creating READMEs. 
It is something I always look forward to for every challenge assignment. It is like writing a story 
of your application. I built this project, so that I can learn how to create a professional README generator 
and what I learn from this project, I can apply it on the upcoming honmework challenges. I'll not only improve 
on creating professional README generators, but also on my writing skills. I personally feel like READMEs has been 
my strongsuit from the beginning. I had Googled how to create a great README and then from there I continued to do
 my best on improving on it. What I learned is that creating a professional README generator is quite 
different from what I am used to, but am open to improving on creating a professional README generator.

## How to Use this Project and Acceptance Criteria


## Technology

<!-- If your project has a lot of features, list them here. -->

## License

<!-- The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
